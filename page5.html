        <p>There two major international tournaments: the World Baseball Classic (WBC) and the Olympics. The World
          Baseball Classic is a tournament that happens every 4 years. The first tournament happened in 2006, where
          Japan beat Cuba in San Diego. The most recent year 2023 (which was delayed becuase of the pandemic), Japan
          also won, where they beat the US 3-2. The next competition will be in 2026. </p>
        <p>At the Olypmics, baseball has been on and off in recent histroy. It was added 1984 and was voted out in 2012.
          However, in 2020, baseball and softball cameback for a trial run. Now it will be officially added to the LA
          Summer Olympics in 2028. </p>
