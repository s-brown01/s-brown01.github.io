      <h2>International Play</h2>
      <div class="contentbox">
        <p>Although baseball has been around for over 150 years, it is still a growing sport. Many East Asian countries
          are starting to get their own leagues and teams. Baseball in both Japan and Korea is very popular, and many of
          the best players from either country end up playing in the MLB. One of the biggest international stars on the
          field was Ichiro Suzuki. He has many fans in Japan, and when he made his MLB debut he only grew in stardom.
          After retiring in 2019, he will be eligible for the MLB Hall of Fame in 2025. </p>
        <p>
          East Asian baseball is growing in popularity, but the majority of players are still from the United States and
          surrounding countries. The majority of MLB players are from the US (1,057 players, ~71%). Japan has 7 MLB
          players (0.5%); South Korea has 6 (0.4%).
          <br />
        </p>
        <ol>
          The top 5 percentage of player in the MLB by country:
          <li>United States - 70.7%</li>
          <li>Dominican Republic - 11.4%</li>
          <li>Venezuela - 7.1%</li>
          <li>Cuba - 2.2%</li>
          <li>Puerto Rico - 1.9%</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

          Not only are leagues very popular around the world, but baseball as a hobby is also growing. Pictured here is
          a group of kids in Bhutan, a very isolated country in the Himalayas, playing baseball in front of a Buddha
          statue. This photo was taken by Matthew DeSantis
