      <div class="contentbox">
        <p>The Minor Leagues (MiLB) is a generic term for the pro-am leagues. There are many different leagues around
          the country. However, after the COVID pandemic, the number of MLB-affiliated teams were reduced. Now there are
          only 120 MiLB teams, 4 for each of the 30 Major league team. The 4 levels are Triple-A (AAA), Double-A (AA),
          High-A (A+), and Single-A (A). </p>

        <p>
          Besides those 4 affiliated leagues, there are other pro-am leagues around the country, such as the Pioneer
          League in Montana and some surrounding states. Many of those leagues were MLB-affiliated, but after COVID,
          they are now different independent leagues.
