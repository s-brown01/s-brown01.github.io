      <h2>Major League Baseball</h2>
      <div class="contentbox">
        <p>Major League Baseball is the highest level of baseball in United. It is also one of the highest levels in all
          of the world. Players from around the world come to the US solely to play professional baseball. It is one of
          the highest paid sports in the world. The biggest contract ever signed for any sport was by Shohei Ohtani,
          signing for $700 Million spread for 10 years being playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 5 out of the 10
          biggest sports contracts ever are from baseball. Although many players do not get paid that much, the average
          salary was $4.9 Million in 2023.

        <p>The MLB is divided into 2 leagues: the American and National Leagues. Each league has 3 divisions, each of
          which has 4 teams. This makes a total of 30 teams. My favorite team is the Seattle Mariners, who were created
          in 1977. They, unfortunately, are the only team that have never appeared in a World Series and are one of 5
          teams that have never one a world series. They do have a Perfect Game, one of the rarest and most difficult
          achievements in sports. This is when a pitcher gets every batter out in a game, with no one getting on base.
          Felix Hernandez (pictured) threw the Mariners' only perfect game on August 15, 2012.
